# Version Control Policy

## Introduction

This policy outlines the version control practices to be followed by all contributors to the project. Effective version control is essential for collaboration, tracking changes, and ensuring code stability.

## 1. Version Control System

The project will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system.

## 2. Repository Structure

- The repository will follow a clear and organized structure.
- Main branches:
  - `main` (or `master`): Represents the stable production-ready code.
  - `develop`: Integration branch for ongoing development.
- Feature branches:
  - Named descriptively (e.g., `feature/login-page`).

## 3. Branching Workflow

- **Feature Development:**
  - Create a new branch from `develop` for each feature.
  - Use feature branches for changes and enhancements.
  - Branch naming convention: `feature/{feature-name}`.

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Create a new branch from `main` for bug fixes.
  - Use bug branches for fixing critical issues.
  - Branch naming convention: `bugfix/{issue-number}`.

- **Pull Requests:**
  - Create pull requests (PRs) for merging feature/bugfix branches into `develop` or `main`.
  - PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one team member.

## 4. Commit Guidelines

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Include Jira or issue numbers in commit messages if applicable.

## 5. Versioning

- Use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) for version numbers.
- Increment versions based on the nature of changes: major, minor, patch.

## 6. Tagging

- Tag releases in Git to mark specific points in the version history.
- Tagging format: `vX.X.X` (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

## 7. Code Review

- All code changes must undergo code review before merging.
- Address feedback received during code review promptly.

## 8. Continuous Integration

- Integrate CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment processes.
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines are triggered on branch pushes.

## 9. Documentation

- Maintain a clear and updated README file.
- Include instructions for setting up the project and contributing.

## 10. Gitignore

- Utilize a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories.

## Conclusion

By adhering to this version control policy, we aim to maintain a streamlined and collaborative development process, ensuring the stability and reliability of our codebase.
