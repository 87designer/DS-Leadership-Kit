# Skill-Appropriate Analysis & Coding Tests

## Analyst Level:

### Analysis Test:
1. **Task: Basic Data Analysis**
   - Dataset: Given a CSV file with sample data, perform basic data analysis. Provide summary statistics, identify trends, and visualize key insights.

### Coding Test:
2. **Task: Excel/SQL Proficiency**
   - Test the candidate's ability to write SQL queries or perform data manipulation tasks in Excel. Include tasks like filtering, sorting, and summarizing data.

## Junior Data Scientist Level:

### Analysis Test:
3. **Task: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Dataset: Provide a dataset with multiple variables. Task the candidate with conducting an exploratory data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and initial insights.

### Coding Test:
4. **Task: Implementing a Simple Machine Learning Model**
   - Provide a dataset and ask the candidate to implement a basic machine learning model (e.g., linear regression or decision tree) using Python or R.

## Mid-Level Data Scientist Level:

### Analysis Test:
5. **Task: Time Series Analysis**
   - Dataset: Present a time series dataset. Request the candidate to perform time series analysis, identify patterns, and make predictions for future values.

### Coding Test:
6. **Task: Advanced Machine Learning Model**
   - Ask the candidate to implement a more complex machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and evaluate its performance on a given dataset.

## Senior Data Scientist Level:

### Analysis Test:
7. **Task: Business Impact Analysis**
   - Present a real-world business scenario. Ask the candidate to analyze the impact of a data-driven decision on the business, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors.

### Coding Test:
8. **Task: Production-Level Code Review**
   - Provide a snippet of code that simulates a part of a production-level data science pipeline. Ask the candidate to review the code, identify potential improvements, and discuss scalability considerations.

## Additional Skill Tests:

### For All Levels:

### Communication and Documentation:
9. **Task: Communication and Documentation**
   - Request a brief report or documentation based on the analysis or coding task performed, evaluating the candidate's ability to communicate findings effectively.

### For Mid-Level and Senior Levels:

### Stakeholder Presentation:
10. **Task: Stakeholder Presentation**
    - Simulate a scenario where the candidate needs to present their analysis or model findings to non-technical stakeholders. Assess their ability to convey complex concepts in a clear and understandable manner.
