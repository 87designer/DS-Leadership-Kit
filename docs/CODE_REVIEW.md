# Data Science Code Review Policy

## Introduction

This policy outlines the guidelines and best practices for conducting code reviews in data science projects. Code reviews play a crucial role in maintaining code quality, ensuring reproducibility, and fostering collaboration among team members.

## 1. Code Review Process

- **Initiation:**
  - Code reviews should be initiated for all significant changes to the codebase.
  - Assign a reviewer(s) for each code review.

- **Repository Branches:**
  - Main branches:
    - `main` (or `master`): Represents the stable production-ready code.
    - `develop`: Integration branch for ongoing development.
  - Feature branches:
    - Named descriptively (e.g., `feature/data-preprocessing`).

- **Review Frequency:**
  - Aim for regular code review sessions, ideally integrating them into the development workflow.

## 2. Code Review Criteria

- **Reproducibility:**
  - Code should be reproducible, and dependencies must be clearly documented.
  - Include version information for all libraries used.

- **Documentation:**
  - Clear and concise documentation for functions, methods, and workflows.
  - Include a README file explaining the purpose of the project, data sources, and how to reproduce results.

- **Data Quality and Preprocessing:**
  - Validate and document data quality checks and preprocessing steps.
  - Include data exploration and visualization for better understanding.

- **Model Performance:**
  - Include evaluation metrics for model performance.
  - Validate the model against appropriate benchmarks.

- **Code Readability:**
  - Follow a consistent coding style.
  - Use meaningful variable and function names.
  - Comment complex code sections.

## 3. Collaboration and Feedback

- **Constructive Feedback:**
  - Provide feedback that is constructive, specific, and focused on improvement.
  - Highlight both positive aspects and areas for enhancement.

- **Collaborative Discussions:**
  - Encourage open discussions during code reviews.
  - Use threaded comments to facilitate conversation.

## 4. Version Control Integration

- **Git Commits and Messages:**
  - Follow a clear and consistent commit message format.
  - Reference Jira or issue numbers in commit messages.

- **Branch Protection:**
  - Implement branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to main branches.
  - Require code review approval before merging.

## 5. Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Automated Tests:**
  - Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Ensure tests cover critical components of the data science pipeline.

- **Reproducibility Checks:**
  - Implement CI checks for data reproducibility.
  - Verify that the entire analysis pipeline can be executed successfully.

## 6. Conclusion

By adhering to this data science code review policy, we aim to enhance the quality, reproducibility, and collaboration within our data science projects. Regular and thorough code reviews contribute to the overall success of our data-driven initiatives.
