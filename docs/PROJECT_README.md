## How to Reproduce Results

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   - Install dependencies using the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Data Download and Preprocessing:**
   - Run the data preprocessing script to download and preprocess the data:

     ```bash
     python scripts/data_processing.py
     ```

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Open and run the `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` notebook to explore the data:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb
     ```

4. **Model Training:**
   - Execute the `model_training.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the model:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb
     ```

5. **Model Deployment (if applicable):**
   - Provide instructions for deploying the model in a production environment, if applicable.
