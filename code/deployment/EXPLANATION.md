Explanation:

The script uses Flask to create a simple web server.
The /predict endpoint is set up to accept POST requests with input data for making predictions.
The trained model (model.joblib) is loaded during the initialization of the Flask app.
When a POST request is received, the input data is converted to a Pandas DataFrame, and predictions are made using the loaded model.
The predictions are then returned as a JSON response.
Note: This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you may need to consider security, scalability, and other deployment aspects. Additionally, the model should be trained and saved separately before deploying, and the script should handle any necessary preprocessing steps based on the model requirements.
