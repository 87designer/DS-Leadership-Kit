Explanation:

The script uses Plotly Graphing Objects to create two traces (lines) for temperature and humidity.

Custom styling is applied to each trace using the line property within the go.Scatter objects.

The layout is defined using go.Layout to customize the title, x-axis, y-axis, and legend.

The go.Figure object is then created with the specified traces and layout.

The resulting visualization is saved as an HTML file (temperature_humidity_visualization.html) and displayed in a new browser window.

Feel free to further customize the styling, traces, or layout based on your specific preferences and dataset characteristics.
