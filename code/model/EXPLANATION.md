Explanation:

The script defines a function build_and_train_model that takes the path to a CSV dataset as input, loads the data, and trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn.

It splits the data into training and testing sets, initializes a linear regression model, trains the model, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model using mean squared error.

The trained model is then saved using joblib for future use.

Make sure to customize this script based on the specific requirements of your project, such as selecting the appropriate model, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics for your use case.
